College Essay Summarization & Analysis Project

This project demonstrates how to summarize a student essay using an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) in Google Colab, applying three different prompting methods:

Simple Prompting

Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Tree of Thoughts Prompting

The goal is to explore how different prompting styles affect the quality and depth of summaries. This exercise was also completed while thinking from the perspective of an admissions officer, to understand how summarization techniques could assist in evaluating student essays more efficiently.

Project Steps

Wrote an essay and saved it as a .txt file.

Uploaded the text file to Google Colab.

Used an open-source LLM from Hugging Face to generate summaries.

Applied three summarization techniques:

Simple Prompting (short and direct)

Chain-of-Thought Prompting (step-by-step reasoning)

Tree of Thoughts Prompting (multiple perspective summary)

Saved all summaries into a single output text file.

Wrote a short reflection about the learning experience.
